# Processes-Scheduler 🤖🏿

A Processes-Scheduler designed to organize and schedule processes efficiently using various scheduling algorithms. This project serves as a C++ practice for implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and data structures such as queues, stacks, and trees. It was developed as a college project.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/eslamwageh/Processes-Scheduler.git`
2. Download a C++ compiler, such as Visual Studio.
3. Open the project.sln file and start interacting with the program using the provided input samples folder in the repository.

## Features

- The scheduler supports three different scheduling algorithms: Round Robin, First Come First Serve, and Shortest Job First.
- The project utilizes OOP principles to model processes and their scheduling.
- Data structures like queues, stacks, and trees are employed to organize and manage the processes efficiently.
